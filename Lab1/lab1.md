In this lab, you aim to run a simple survival analysis using the Bone marrow transplant: children dataset, which describes pediatric patients with several hematologic diseases. The dataset is publicly available in the UCI repository.

Steps:

  1. Do some exploratory analysis to design the patient's features to be used. What features have missing values, which do not seem to correlate with the survival time, and what groups of features are jointly correlated.
  1. Given the set of features, run some clustering algorithms to separate the patients into groups. You can use K-means, DBScan, or any other. Clustering can be done over the input feature or a reduced space using PCA or a VAE.
  1. Compute the survival function for each group using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression. Analyze the differences between both methods and the survival differences between groups. In terms of interpretability, recall that Cox provides a feature importance.
  1. Summarize everything in a two-page report with a link to your code (use Google Drive or Github).


Steps 1 and 2 are expected to be completed in the first session, and steps 3 and 4 in the second one. You can work individually or in groups of up to three people (don't forget to add the names of all members at the beginning of your report).

This lab counts up to 1.25 points in the overall grade. The deadline is October 16th (flexible). Please refer to the submission link for more details on the report.

Have fun!
